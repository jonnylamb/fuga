ui
==

* display activity timings in the row?

* use GtkBuilder

* work out what to do with icons

* implement multi-delete

* does deleting the last item break things? probably.

O add a .desktop file

* move strava UI code out of activities.py

misc
====

O work out name: correre or corri?

garmin connectivity
===================

* add a timeout when connecting

* ensure garmin connected to on a reconnection is the same one!

O work out why device busy warning always appears

O push all openant changes upstream

design
======

* make queuing not really ugly

* add "list current items" device as fakegarmin

* rename fakegarmin to something like dirlist and add edge 800 device

O change activity directory, losing garmin-extractor compatibility

known issues
============

* https://github.com/Tigge/openant/issues/14
